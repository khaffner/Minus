# Minus
This repo contains code and config for the Pi in our Mitsubishi i-Miev named "Minus".

Mostly containerized, some parts run locally.

Most documentation is in a private google doc.
But long story short: Get OBD and GPS data, show them in Home Assistant on car Radio display and sync them to a folder in Google Drive.
